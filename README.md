# Contacts Per Order Calculation Tool

In a consumer service environment for a toy manufacturer, it is important to consider multiple metrics such as the number of phone calls, emails and chat contacts received. Raw numbers are good to look at as well as trends over time. However, this shouldn't be the only base metrics used as the toy industry is very seasonal and demand greatly varies over time. Comparing the number of contacts to the number of orders placed by consumers on the website takes this seasonality into account. This is implemented in dataflows but executives often needs quicker numbers, for example to add to presentation or taking decisions during high-stress periods like Black Friday/Cyber Monday, before the winter holiday season or when an unpredicted issue arises.
Our contacts per order calculation tool will provide a quick solution for executives to input the number of contacts and orders and provide a contact per order calculation. For the purpose of this assignment, data will be manually inputed but in the workplace, the app will be linked to our internal order dataflow for a more automatised and easy process for users.
